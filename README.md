# Infra Declaration

## Goal
My Goal is centralize, save, and keep the structure available.
All of it, to rebuild the infra quickly.

This repo will receive some config file, to save the config for every services.
e.g. sshd.cfg haproxy.cfg

It will also receive some script in Shell, Python and I'm not lazy PowerShell.

For the understanding for visitors and myself, an array with IP, Service;
and Schema of KNetwork.
